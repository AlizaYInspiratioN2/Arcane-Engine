Nice To Have:
-Move Anistropic amount querying to the defs.h or something instead of querying the driver for every texture
-Uniform buffer objects (to push shader data with one GPU call)

Normal mapping:
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere

Skybox:
-Should be HDR
-Skybox should render an NDC cube from the modelRenderer (instead of storing it's own)

Shadows:
-Look into moving shadowmap stuff into light manager
-Fix terrain shadows

IBL:
-IBL shadow resolution should be defined somewhere
-Proper probe blending will need to be implemented
-A more efficient system for selecting which probes to blend (ideally using a quadtree)

Deferred:
-Add light volumes (very important for lots of lights in deferred)
