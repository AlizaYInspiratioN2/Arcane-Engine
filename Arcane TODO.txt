Nice To Have:
-Also should ensure proper state is set (ie multisample etc)
-Move Anistropic amount querying to the defs.h or something instead of querying the driver for every texture

Normal mapping:
-Make normal mapping code work on terrain (need to calculate tangents and bitangents for terrain vertices)
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere

PBR:
-Make the terrain use a PBR shader

Skybox:
-Should be HDR

IBL:
-Proper probe blending will need to be implemented
-Better system for binding
