TODO:
-Move Anistropic amount querying to the defs.h or something instead of querying the driver for every texture
-Need support for textures/cubemaps de-allocation/cleanup. So streaming support can be easier integrated into the engine in the future
-Better define the render passes with names so RenderDoc can easily see the passes
-Clean up shaders so they are properly adding up light and multiplying with sampled data only when needed. Instead of oversampling
-Terrain needs multiple light support (only supports 1 atm)
-Investigate red specular? from point light on Sponza

Shadow mapping:
-Investigate crappy self shadows on models

Normal mapping:
-Make normal mapping code work on terrain (need to calculate tangents and bitangents for terrain vertices)
-Investigate if the normals are right from normal mapping and their strange artifacts!
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere
-Remove bad shaders or rename the ones that we have to be more fitting

Post Processing:
-See if super sampling can be an easy integration. Since the post processor will blit to a RenderTarget that matches the screen's resolution
-Update README with new screenshots and features!!
