Nice To Have:
-Move Anistropic amount querying to the defs.h or something instead of querying the driver for every texture

Normal mapping:
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere

Skybox:
-Should be HDR
-Skybox should render an NDC cube from the modelRenderer (instead of storing it's own)

Shadows:
-Look into moving shadowmap stuff into light manager
-Fix terrain shadows

IBL:
-IBL shadow resolution should be defined somewhere
-Proper probe blending will need to be implemented
-A more efficient system for selecting which probes to blend (ideally using a quadtree)

Deferred:
-Add light volumes (very important for lots of lights in deferred)

TODO:
-Framebuffers do not need a depth buffer (stuff like the SSAO framebuffer, convolution framebuffer etc. Do not need a depth attachment so we can remove it and save some VRAM)
-For the SSAO framebuffer do we need to have pixel data set to GL_FLOAT for the framebuffer (doubt it cause it should have no data initially)
-Texture::generate(...) should have const *void data as the last arg
-Look at making a function in shader to set an array of data so LightManager and PostProcessor's SSAO hemipshere sample kernel can be set with one GPU call
