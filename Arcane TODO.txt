Nice To Have:
-Uniform buffer objects (to push shader data with one GPU call)

Normal mapping:
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere

Skybox:
-Should be HDR
-Skybox should render an NDC cube from the modelRenderer (instead of storing it's own)

IBL:
-IBL shadow resolution should be defined somewhere
-Proper probe blending will need to be implemented
-A more efficient system for selecting which probes to blend (ideally using a quadtree)

Deferred:
-Add light volumes (very important for lots of lights in deferred)
