Nice To Have:
-Move Anistropic amount querying to the defs.h or something instead of querying the driver for every texture

Normal mapping:
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere

Skybox:
-Should be HDR

Shadows:
-Look into moving shadowmap stuff into light manager

IBL:
-Proper probe blending will need to be implemented
-A more efficient system for selecting which probes to blend (ideally using a quadtree)

Deferred:
-Rewrite Framebuffer's so forward framebuffers and the GBuffer work nicely together
-New framebuffer system should have more control over the framebuffer's format instead of making everything with a depth buffer use the same precision
-Functions for has stencil etc need to be added for safety
-Look into 32 bit depth + stencil
-Look into making framebuffer's hold textures instead of unsigned int
-Color attachment adding either adds floating point for MSAA or RGB for a non-msaa. WTF

-Master Renderer should own the renderers (ModelRenderer)
-Skybox should render an NDC cube from the modelRenderer (instead of storing it's own)
