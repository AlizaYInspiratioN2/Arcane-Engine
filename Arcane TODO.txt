Nice To Have:
-Move Anistropic amount querying to the defs.h or something instead of querying the driver for every texture

Normal mapping:
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere

Skybox:
-Should be HDR

Shadows:
-Look into moving shadowmap stuff into light manager

IBL:
-IBL shadow resolution should be defined somewhere
-Proper probe blending will need to be implemented
-A more efficient system for selecting which probes to blend (ideally using a quadtree)

Deferred:
-Rewrite Framebuffer's so forward framebuffers and the GBuffer work nicely together
-Look into making framebuffer's hold textures instead of unsigned int
-When setting the colour attachment we should call the function we defined

-Master Renderer should own the renderers (ModelRenderer)
-Skybox should render an NDC cube from the modelRenderer (instead of storing it's own)
