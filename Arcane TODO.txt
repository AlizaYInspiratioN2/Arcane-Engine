Nice To Have:
-Move Anistropic amount querying to the defs.h or something instead of querying the driver for every texture

Normal mapping:
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere

Skybox:
-Should be HDR

IBL:
-Proper probe blending will need to be implemented
-A more efficient system for selecting which probes to blend (ideally using a quadtree)

Deferred:
-Rewrite Framebuffer's so forward framebuffers and the GBuffer work nicely together
-New framebuffer system should have more control over the framebuffer's format instead of making everything with a depth buffer use the same precision
-Functions for has stencil etc need to be added for safety
-Master Renderer should own the renderers (ModelRenderer)
-Skybox should render an NDC cube from the modelRenderer (instead of storing it's own)
-also make fragPos named after the space it is in
-Also redo Cubemap generation to follow the same texture settings as textures do now
-Look into moving shadowmap stuff into light manager
-Look into making framebuffer's hold textures instead of unsigned int
-Look into extracting near + far in deferred lighting shader (from the projection matrix)
-Redo render pass type because it is not ideal with a large # of render passes
-Look into 32 bit depth + stencil
