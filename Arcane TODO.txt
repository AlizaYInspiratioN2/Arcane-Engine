Nice To Have:
-Move Anistropic amount querying to the defs.h or something instead of querying the driver for every texture
-Better define the render passes with names so RenderDoc can easily see the passes

Normal mapping:
-Make normal mapping code work on terrain (need to calculate tangents and bitangents for terrain vertices)
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere

PBR:
-Make the terrain use a PBR shader
-Terrain needs multiple light support (only supports 1 atm)

IBL:
-Implement Diffuse IBL in the shader (and work around when nothing is bound)
-Implement Specular IBL in the shader (and work around when nothing is bound)
-Finish probes and their convolution + usage
-Should split the probe system into two separate. Light Probes (indirect diffuse irradiance) and Reflection Probes (specular IBL)
-Proper probe blending will need to be implemented (fallback methods too)
