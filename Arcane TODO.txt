Nice To Have:
-Move Anistropic amount querying to the defs.h or something instead of querying the driver for every texture

Normal mapping:
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere

Skybox:
-Should be HDR

IBL:
-Proper probe blending will need to be implemented
-A more efficient system for selecting which probes to blend (ideally using a quadtree)

Deferred:
-Rewrite Framebuffer's so forward framebuffers and the GBuffer work nicely together
-Master Renderer should own the renderers (ModelRenderer)
-Skybox should render an NDC cube from the modelRenderer (instead of storing it's own)
-Move to view space shading (viewPos isn't needed and will save an additonal mat4 multiplication on the fragment's depth in view -> world)
-also make fragPos named after the space it is in
-Look into moving shadowmap stuff into light manager
-Create texture unit statics (shadowmap, irradianceMap, prefilterMap, brdfLUT)
-Look into making framebuffer's hold textures instead of unsigned int
-Look into extracting near + far in deferred lighting shader (from the projection matrix)
-Redo render pass type because it is not ideal with a large # of render passes
