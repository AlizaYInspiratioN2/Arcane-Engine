Nice To Have:
-Move Anistropic amount querying to the defs.h or something instead of querying the driver for every texture
-Better define the render passes with names so RenderDoc can easily see the passes

Normal mapping:
-Make normal mapping code work on terrain (need to calculate tangents and bitangents for terrain vertices)
-Specify tangents and bitangents for a cube and sphere

PBR:
-Make the terrain use a PBR shader
-Terrain needs multiple light support (only supports 1 atm)

Skybox:
-Should be HDR

IBL:
-IBL Code Cleanup + Documentation (for the shaders)
-Should only render static entities (models and lights atm) to each reflection and light probe. This also means each entity needs a static class or type that shouldn't let you change it's properties
-Also should ensure proper state is set (ie multisample etc)
-Also look into RenderPassType and see if that is the best way or if we should just do render specific stuff (ie NOMATERIAL)
-Proper probe blending will need to be implemented
