# Arcane-Engine
Arcane Engine is a real-time game engine developed and maintained by [Tyrannical Games](https://ershany.github.io/). A large focus of this project is to develop an in-house engine catered to building indie games. Arcane's development roadmap will be game development driven, meaning it will be influenced by actually making games and prioritizing features needed to ship great indie games at [Tyrannical Games](https://ershany.github.io/)
